- Ensure that all generated Python 3.7 code is compatible with Python 3.7.0 syntax and features.
- When creating new functions or classes, be as fine-grained as possible. If an operation requires more than three steps, it should be broken down into smaller helper functions or classes.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to enhance code readability.
- Do not include type hints for function parameters and return types - keep args and return types untyped for Python 3.7 compatibility and simplicity.
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values
- Do not make any changes to existing code outside of the generated sections.
- Avoid using external libraries unless absolutely necessary. Prefer standard library solutions when available.
- Write unit tests for all new functions and classes, ensuring at least 90% code coverage.
- Do not change failing tests to make them pass; instead, fix the underlying issues in the code.
- Do not change the names of existing functions, classes, or variables unless told to do so.
- Ensure that all code adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines.
