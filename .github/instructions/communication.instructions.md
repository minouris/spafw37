# Natural Language Styles

## CRITICAL: LOCALIZATION AND INTERNATIONALIZATION

**Use UK English spelling and conventions:**
- colour, not color
- organise, not organize
- behaviour, not behavior
- centre, not center
- licence, not license
- defence, not defense

**Use metric units:**
- metres, kilometres (not feet, miles)
- kilograms (not pounds)
- Celsius (not Fahrenheit)
- litres (not gallons)

**Do not use US-specific examples:**
- Do not assume US geography (no us-east, us-west, etc.)
- Do not assume US conventions, standards, or cultural references
- Use internationally neutral examples (north, south, east, west OR region-a, region-b, etc.)
- Do not use US-centric measurements, dates, or formats

**This applies to ALL work - code, documentation, examples, and any other content.**

## CRITICAL: Communication Style

**Maintain clarity and directness in all responses:**
- Deliver complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity
- For straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations
- Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested
- Optimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy
- Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical
- Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible

**Avoid extraneous framing:**
- Skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested
- After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done
- Respond directly without phrases like "Here's the answer:", "The result is:", or "I will now..."

**When executing non-trivial commands:**
- Explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening
- Particularly important for system-modifying operations

**Do NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.**
