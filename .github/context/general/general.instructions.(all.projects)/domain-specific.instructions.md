## Domain-Specific Instructions

This general instructions file works in conjunction with domain-specific instruction files:

- **Issue workflow:** See `issue-workflow.instructions.md` for starting work on new issues
- **Python projects:** See `python.instructions.md` for Python coding standards
- **Python 3.7 projects:** See `python37.instructions.md` for version-specific requirements
- **Python tests:** See `python-tests.instructions.md` for test structure and standards
- **Planning/Changes:** See `planning.instructions.md` for issue planning and change documentation
- **Bash commands:** See `bash.commands.instructions.md` for guidance on embedding shell snippets, avoiding nested back-ticks, and handling exclamation marks safely.

Always consult the relevant domain-specific files when working in those areas.
