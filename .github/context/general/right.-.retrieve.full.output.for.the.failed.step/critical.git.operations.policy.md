## CRITICAL: Git Operations Policy

**YOU MAY NOT COMMIT CODE. YOU MAY NOT PUSH CODE.**

You do not have permission to run `git commit` or `git push` under any circumstances. These operations must be performed by the human user only.

**Rationale:** You have repeatedly claimed work was complete when it was not, making it unsafe to allow you to commit or push changes.
