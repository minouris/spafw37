## Documentation Requirements

**All code must include appropriate documentation:**
- Public functions and classes require comprehensive docstrings
- Private/internal helpers require at minimum a one-line docstring explaining purpose
- Docstrings should explain purpose, inputs, outputs, and side-effects
- Use proper formatting for the language (e.g., Markdown for documentation files, language-specific docstring conventions for code)

**Code examples in documentation must follow all coding rules:**
- Python code examples must follow `python.instructions.md` naming and style rules
- Python 3.7 projects must follow `python37.instructions.md` compatibility rules
- Test code examples must follow `python-tests.instructions.md` structure rules
- All code in documentation is subject to the same standards as production code
- Do not use lazy placeholders or poor naming in examples - they teach bad habits
