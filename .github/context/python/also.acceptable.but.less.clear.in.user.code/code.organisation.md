## Code Organisation

**Function responsibilities:**
- Each function should have a single, clear responsibility
- Keep functions small and focused (max 3 distinct steps before extracting helpers)
- Use descriptive variable names that indicate purpose
- Extract complex logic into named helper functions

**Refer to "Nested-Structure and Single-Responsibility Rules" section above for:**
- Maximum nesting depth limits (2 levels)
- Maximum nested block size limits (2 lines)
- Mandatory extraction requirements
- Testing requirements for all helper methods
- Detailed examples of correct code structure
