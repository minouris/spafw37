## Planning Documents - Decision Status

**CRITICAL:** When creating or updating planning documents in `features/`:

- **Never mark decisions as "RESOLVED" without explicit user confirmation**
- Use "PENDING REVIEW" for proposed answers to "Further Considerations"
- Only change status to "RESOLVED" when the user explicitly approves the decision
- Decisions are resolved when the user is satisfied, not when the agent proposes an answer
