## Links and References

### Internal Links

- Use relative paths for links within the repository
- Verify links work from the file's location
- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")

**Example:**
```markdown
See [Parameters Guide](parameters.md) for details.
See [Configuration section](configuration.md#basic-configuration) for examples.
```

### External Links

- Use full URLs for external resources
- Include link text that describes the destination
- Verify links are current and accessible

### Code References

- Use backticks for inline code: `function_name()`
- Use triple backticks for code blocks with language specification
- Reference specific files, functions, or line numbers when relevant
