## Coverage Requirements

**Minimum test coverage standards:**
- Write unit tests for all new functions and classes
- Aim for high coverage (80%+ minimum, 90%+ recommended)
- Test both success and failure paths
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Do not modify tests to make them pass; fix the underlying code instead
