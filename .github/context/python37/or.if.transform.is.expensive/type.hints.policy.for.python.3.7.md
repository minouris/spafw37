## Type Hints Policy for Python 3.7

**Do not add type hints for function parameters and return types:**
- Keep arguments and return types untyped for Python 3.7 compatibility and simplicity
- Python 3.7's typing module has limitations compared to later versions
- Avoiding type hints reduces complexity and improves readability for this version
- Focus on clear naming and comprehensive docstrings instead
