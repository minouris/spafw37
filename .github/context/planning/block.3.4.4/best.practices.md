## Best Practices

**Be specific and factual:**
- State exactly what was added, changed, or removed
- Include function names, file paths, and technical details
- Avoid vague descriptions like "improved performance" without metrics

**Think about the user:**
- What do they need to know to use this feature?
- What will break if they upgrade?
- What do they need to change in their code?

**Maintain consistency:**
- Use the same format for similar items
- Follow the established templates exactly
- Keep tone and style consistent throughout
