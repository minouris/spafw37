## Documentation Update Requirements

When adding new features, always update:
- `README.md` - Reflect new functionality in features list, code examples, examples list
- Add "What's New in vX.Y.Z" section
- Add "**Added in vX.Y.Z**" notes at the start of new documentation sections
- This helps users discover new features and understand when they were introduced
