## Design Patterns to Consider

### Recommended Patterns
- **Adapter**: Isolate protocol and platform specifics
- **Mediator**: Central control coordinating components
- **Observer/Listener**: Event-driven communication
- **Command**: Encapsulate operations as objects
- **Factory**: Enable dependency injection and testing
- **State**: Model component lifecycle
- **Strategy**: Pluggable algorithms and behaviour variations

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **God Object**: Distribute responsibilities appropriately
- **Tight Coupling**: Use interfaces and dependency injection
- **Premature Optimisation**: Design for clarity first
- **Feature Creep**: Focus on core requirements
- **Monolithic Components**: Favour small, focused components
