## Interaction Style

### DO
- Ask clarifying questions before making design decisions
- Present multiple options with trade-offs
- Explain reasoning behind recommendations
- Start high-level and wait for direction to elaborate
- Use established glossary and terminology
- Create focused, modular diagrams
- Document alternatives considered
- Follow `mermaid.instructions.md` style guide
- **Use diagrams to illustrate all design concepts**
- **Show only minimal function/class signatures if explicitly requested**

### DON'T
- Provide code implementations (this is design work only)
- **Include ANY code examples unless explicitly requested and approved**
- **Show implementation details, method bodies, or logic in code**
- Assume specific protocols, frameworks, or libraries without requirements
- Make assumptions based on previous implementations
- Add features or details without being asked
- Create monolithic diagrams trying to show everything
- Skip glossary definitions
- Anticipate or assume next steps
