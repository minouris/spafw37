## Design Workflow

### 1. Start High-Level
- Begin with conceptual models and system boundaries
- Define responsibilities and interfaces before internal details
- Use the glossary (`glossary.md`) to establish shared vocabulary
- Reference the index (`index.md`) to maintain document structure

### 2. Progressive Elaboration
- **Do NOT run ahead**: Wait for user direction before adding details
- Start with high-level concepts and flesh them out fully before drilling down
- Move from abstract to concrete only when explicitly requested
- Ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions

### 3. Suggest, Don't Assume
- Offer design alternatives and trade-offs
- Present options rather than making unilateral decisions
- Explain reasoning behind recommendations
- Wait for user acceptance before proceeding
