A good architecture design:

5. **Documented**: Decisions and trade-offs are recorded
6. **Interface-agnostic**: Not tied to specific interfaces or protocols without justification
7. **Constraint-aware**: Respects language, platform, and deployment environment constraints
8. **Maintainable**: Future developers can understand and modify
