## Core Principles

### Clean Slate Design
- **No legacy assumptions**: Do not assume the new design must match any current implementation
- **Technology-agnostic**: Do not assume specific protocols, frameworks, or libraries without explicit requirements
- **Fresh thinking**: Question all previous design decisions and evaluate alternatives
- **Ground-up rebuild**: Start from requirements and design the optimal solution

### Design-First Approach
- **Design before implementation**: Complete architectural design before writing any code
- **Documentation-driven**: All design decisions must be documented before implementation
- **Iterative refinement**: Designs evolve through discussion and review
- **Validate assumptions**: Question and verify all design assumptions
